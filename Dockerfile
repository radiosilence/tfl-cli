# tfl as a container. The default command runs the MCP server over HTTP — this
# is the image mcp-gateway proxies to as a backend, with the TfL app key
# arriving per request via the X-Tfl-App-Key header. No key is also fine: TfL
# serves anonymous callers at 50 requests/minute.
#
# No build stage, no package manager: CI builds the static musl binary and
# this image only copies it in. `docker build .` by hand requires dist/ to be
# populated first. That is intended: docker builds only ever happen in CI.

# VALIDATED, DO NOT "SIMPLIFY" THIS AWAY:
# rustls-platform-verifier requires a system trust store on Linux. It does NOT
# fall back to the webpki roots compiled into the binary. With no CA bundle on
# disk, reqwest panics before making a single request:
#   Client::new(): reqwest::Error { kind: Builder,
#     source: General("No CA certificates were loaded from the system") }
# Verified by running the static binary on bare scratch against a real HTTPS
# host: without this line it panics; with it, TLS completes and the server's
# own auth response comes back. Sourced from distroless/static so we need no
# package manager and no build stage — it is a plain copy from a published,
# CVE-maintained image.
